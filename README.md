# Vaxsys---Vaccination-Management-System - Prototype

## VAXSYS is expected to have several capabilities, including the following:
* It will allow people using essentially any computing device, at any time, and fromanywhere to schedule an appointment for a vaccination, cancel an appointment, and
provide pertinent personal details for such an appointment (including, but not limited to, name, address, age, any current medications, and any allergies).
* It will have information on the types of vaccines for multiple, common, infectious diseases.
* It will have information (address, contact information, and so on) on vaccine centers.
* It will provide instructions to potential vaccine recipients for vaccination.
* It will be able to remind people of their vaccination appointment.
* It should allow an individual to receive mixed doses of different types of vaccines for the same infectious disease.
* It should not allow an individual without a valid personal identification to receive a
vaccine.
* It should not allow an individual to receive more than the number of authorized doses
of a vaccine for a particular infectious disease.
* It will be able to provide vaccine recipients with a proof of vaccination record.
* It will allow authorized personnel to enter pertinent information (including, but not
limited to, any side-effects of vaccination) about a vaccine recipient.
* It will allow information to be archived, modified, navigated, searched, and
retrieved.
* It must be credible, by avoiding misinformation and by avoiding the potential for
infodemic.
* It must be usable, in general, and accessible, in particular, within Canada by
people using a mobile device.
* It must aim to support privacy of information of vaccine recipients.
* It must aim to provide security to all its users (including authorized personnel,
system administrators, and vaccine recipients).
* It must be maintainable. This is important because VAXSYS is expected to evolve
over time. For example, vaccine center’s opening hours or recipient’s personal
information might change.
* VAXSYS could be inspired by other (commercial or non-commercial, open or closed
source) VMS3. However, cloning of an existing VMS is not expected
